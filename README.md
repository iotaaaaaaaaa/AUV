Hi,I'm Girish . I love solving problems and CP enthusiast.Though im a mech student my interest in cs comes purely from the joy of problem-solving. Solving problems on Codeforces gives me dopamine like its like a detox. I like thinking on that particular question in the contest and the timer tiking  , i dont know i like thinking at those times. My goal is to reach ICPC wfinals represnt my country and be the firstone from our clg. In the upcoming end sem holidays hoping to practice and reach a level so that i can quailfy to regionals in the upcoming premilinary round this year. Also  i love to solve rubix-cube and listen music.
